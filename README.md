# Recipr - Advanced Forms Challenge

Traveller, you've successfully tackled the Props and State labs, and even bested
the formidibale React Forms labs, but... what? what is that on the horizon?

# --A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES--

### "YOU?? YOU WERE THE ONE WHO DEFEATED MY LITTLE BROTHER, FORMS LAB?? YOU ARE STRONG, BUT LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN BEST ME!"

## "WHO AM I?"

# "WHO AM I???"

# "I AM ADVANCED FORMS, AND YOU WILL REMEMBER ME!"

### Your Challenge:

Build out a recipe listing application that has two sibling components, a form
for entering a recipe and a recipe list that displays all submitted recipes.
Because recipes can have a variable amount of steps, we will need a form with a
dynamic number of inputs.
