# Recipr - Advanced Forms Challenge

Traveller, you've successfully tackled the Props and State labs, and even bested
the formidibale React Forms labs, but... what? what is that on the horizon?

# --A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES--

### "YOU?? YOU WERE THE ONE WHO DEFEATED MY LITTLE BROTHER, FORMS LAB?? YOU ARE STRONG, BUT LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN BEST ME!"

## "WHO AM I?"

# "WHO AM I???"

# "I AM ADVANCED FORMS, AND YOU WILL REMEMBER ME!"

### Your Challenge:

Build out a recipe listing application that has two sibling components, a form
for entering a recipe and a recipe list that displays all submitted recipes.
Because recipes can have a variable amount of steps, we will need a form with a
dynamic number of inputs. This is a bit more open ended, though there are very
efficient ways to handle the various parts of this challenge.

Your application should look like the following:

#### Deliverables:

It is very recommended to complete each deliverable in order before moving on to
the next, as each builds off the next. As a user of this application, I should
be able to:

* Enter a recipe title and at least one recipe step to start
* Submit a recipe and have it appear in a list of all submitted recipes
* Click a button that creates more inputs for steps. Each step input should be
  controlled using state

BONUS DELIVERABLES:

* Be able to click a button to remove any specific step input
* Add dynamic inputs for ingredients along with buttons to remove, just like
  steps

--

* After both sets of inputs are set up successfully, try to abstract any methods
  you have written to handle adding inputs and updating state so you only need
  **_one_** for both input types

BONUS BONUS DELIVERABLES:

* Implement an Edit button for each recipe that populates your form with the
  existing recipe data, allowing you to change any previously added content.
  **Hint: Think about some unique way to _identify_ each recipe. This will be
  necessary to find the necessary data for a particular recipe.**
* HARD MODE: Implement a Delete button to remove a recipe!

If you manage to complete all deliverables, you may claim a reward from your
instructors.
